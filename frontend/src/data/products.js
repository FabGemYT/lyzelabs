        question: "What is Clenbuterol used for in metabolic research?",
        answer: "Clenbuterol is used for studying beta-2 adrenergic receptor activation, lipolysis mechanisms, and thermogenesis in controlled laboratory settings. For research use only."
      },
      {
        question: "How does Clenbuterol affect thermogenesis in research?",
        answer: "Clenbuterol stimulates thermogenesis through beta-2 receptor activation, making it valuable for studying metabolic pathways and energy expenditure. For research use only, not for human consumption."
