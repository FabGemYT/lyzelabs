The previous AI engineer successfully evolved the Lyze Labs application from a foundational landing page to a comprehensive e-commerce platform. The trajectory highlights iterative development, starting with core pages, then expanding to product details, blog, checkout, and legal sections, always prioritizing premium design, stealth compliance, and SEO. Key technical challenges included resolving data inconsistencies (e.g.,  vs. ), integrating a complex 3D hero animation (), and implementing a full conversion-focused redesign. The engineer demonstrated robust debugging, systematically fixing  loading issues, JSX errors, and routing mismatches. The latest phase involved extensive global refinements, including localized reviews, updated shipping policies, and the creation of a universal order tracking page using AfterShip. The current focus is on completing the full product catalog and resolving a persistent  on product pages, which is blocking the full deployment of the updated catalog and site functionality.

The user initially requested a professional, luxurious, and stealth-compliant e-commerce landing page for Lyze Labs, an international research compound brand. The core problem was to build an SEO-dominant, discreet platform (research use only). The initial build included a hero section with search, featured categories, bestsellers, trust badges, lab reports, FAQs, legal footer, WhatsApp button, and email signup. The project expanded to a full e-commerce ecosystem with individual product pages (10 products), a dedicated reviews section, an expanded blog, a mock crypto checkout, and various legal/shipping pages. Subsequent enhancements involved a high-impact 3D animated peptide vial in the hero section with mouse parallax, followed by a comprehensive conversion-focused redesign (inspired by bulkpeptides.net), emphasizing bold headlines, social proof, benefits-oriented copy, and immediate display of purity/price. The latest request focuses on globalizing reviews, updating shipping policies, adding a universal Track Your Order page, and expanding the product catalog with multiple variants and categories.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on a critical bug fix and the comprehensive expansion of the product catalog. The primary issue encountered was a  on product pages, which was preventing them from rendering correctly. This error likely stems from an issue in how product descriptions or variant data is being parsed or accessed within the  component, particularly concerning schema markup.

Concurrently, the engineer has been tasked with populating the *entire* product catalog as specified by the user, including various peptides, injectables, and oral tablets, each with multiple dose/concentration variants. This involves a complete overhaul of the  data file to ensure all new products are correctly structured with:
*   Appropriate categories (Peptides, Injectables, Oral Tablets, SARMs, Neuropeptides/Nootropics, Sexual Health, Fat Loss Compounds, Hair/Anti-Aging).
*   Dropdown selectors for variants.
*   Correct pricing.
*   Standardized storage instructions (Room temperature unless specified).
*   Product-specific reviews with a global bias (70-80% international, 20-30% Indian) including country flags and professional research language.
*   SEO-optimized meta titles, descriptions, and OpenGraph tags.
*   Inclusion of For Research Use Only â€“ Not for Human Consumption disclaimer.

The engineer has started this process by rewriting  and updating  to handle variants, but the  error is blocking full validation. The user's last instruction explicitly emphasizes completing these tasks without stopping halfway, making the store 100% launch-ready.
